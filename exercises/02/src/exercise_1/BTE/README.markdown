# BTE

### Overview

BTE is a python module for automated extraction of body text from web pages. By body-text I mean extract the main textual content from the page and throw away all the extra non-important stuff like sidebars, navigation bars, header, footer, etc. It can also be used to generate short teasers/summaries.

I wrote BTE about 7 years ago and I don't use it or support it anymore. It worked pretty well when I wrote it originally but I'm not sure how well it works on todays web pages, which may have different tag distributions (e.g. less tables, more javascript). 


### How does BTE work?

BTE extracts the main body of text from a web page. It does this by tokenising the document and performing some shallow processing. The html document is tokenised and represented as a binary string where a 0 represents a tag token and a 1 represents a text token.
If we graph cumulative total tokens on the x axis and cumulative tag tokens on the y axis we get a graph something like that shown below.

<div class="column span-18">

</div>

BTE basically works by finding an i and j where we maximise the number of text tokens between i and j and maximise the number of tag tokens below i and above j.

###Usage

Install it by copying the file to a directory in your PYTHONPATH.

```
import sys,BodyTextExtractor
html = open(sys.argv[1]).read()
p = BodyTextExtractor.HtmlBodyTextExtractor()
p.feed(html)
p.close()
x = p.body_text()
s = p.summary()
t = p.full_text()
print "\n\nSummary:\n",s
print "\nBodytext:\n",x
print "\nFulltext:\n",t
```
